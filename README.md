# Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracker-for-Maximum-Power-Generation
This project focuses on the design and simulation of an intelligent dual-axis solar tracking system that continuously aligns a photovoltaic panel with the sun’s position to maximize energy harvesting efficiency. Unlike fixed panels, the system dynamically tracks both azimuth and elevation angles throughout the day.

## 🌞 Project Overview

This repository presents the design and simulation of a **Dual-Axis Solar Tracking System** developed to maximize photovoltaic (PV) power generation by continuously aligning a solar panel with the sun’s position throughout the day.

Unlike conventional fixed-angle solar panels, which suffer from cosine losses as the sun moves, the proposed system dynamically tracks the sun along both **azimuth (horizontal)** and **elevation (vertical)** axes. This ensures that the solar panel remains nearly perpendicular to incoming solar radiation, significantly improving energy harvesting efficiency.

The system is implemented using a **model-based control approach**, where the solar tracker dynamics are modeled and controlled using **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. **Time-based solar position references** are used instead of light sensors, enabling stable and reliable tracking even under cloudy or non-uniform lighting conditions.

This project demonstrates a **low-cost, efficient, and scalable solar tracking concept**, suitable for educational laboratories, small-scale solar installations, and renewable energy research applications.
