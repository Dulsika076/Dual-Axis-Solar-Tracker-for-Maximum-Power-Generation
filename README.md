# Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracker-for-Maximum-Power-Generation
This project focuses on the design and simulation of an intelligent dual-axis solar tracking system that continuously aligns a photovoltaic panel with the sun’s position to maximize energy harvesting efficiency. Unlike fixed panels, the system dynamically tracks both azimuth and elevation angles throughout the day.
